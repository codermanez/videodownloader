## Q/A
### Isn't this illegal?
No, It isn't, what is illegal however, is redistributing videos as your own, this is a way to enjoy your favourite videos OFFLINE, and not to redistribute them.<br>
I am by no means a lawyer, so you may have to check laws in your area, but most likely, it is perfectly fine to do so.
### Was this hard?
yeah
### Will you add more supported websites?
Maybe, I like to work on this project every once in a while, so new websites might not be for months.
### How do I install this?
Install Python (if you haven't already)<br>
In cmd, install the libraries that are under the section "Libraries Used > Not Included With Python"<br>
**Command: pip install {name of library}**<br>
Then, go to the folder in which the program is in, and type "python vd.py" considering you haven't renamed the file<br>
Finally, follow the instructions that are printed out on screen.
